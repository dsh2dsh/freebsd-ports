Miniflux is a minimalist and opinionated feed reader written in Go.

This is a fork with more features like

  * Multiple log files.
  * Limit max number of connections per server and rate of connections.
  * Republished entries marked as unread.
  * Mark entries as read when scrolled and infinite scroll.
  * Don't trust HTTP headers `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Real-IP` by default.
  * Naive deduplication of feed entries.
  * Inline entry reader.
  * Show feed errors in the list of entries, as a pseudo entry.

and so on.
